# 🚨 Phishing Simulation & Security Awareness Project 🛡️  
*Real-World Cybersecurity Project – Beginner Friendly but Powerful*

---

## 🔍 Overview  
Over the past few weeks, I designed and implemented a full phishing simulation campaign to mirror real-world attacks and build a complete security awareness program.

---

## ✅ Project Highlights  

- Simulated phishing attacks using real tactics seen in the last 90 days  
- Designed **custom phishing email templates** to mimic real-world threats  
- Created a **vulnerability scoring system** to identify high-risk users  
- Developed **targeted training materials** for the most vulnerable groups  
- Built a **management-friendly report** that translates tech risk into business impact  

---

## 🔧 Tools Used  

- **Google Workspace** (Docs, Forms, Gmail)  
- **Canva** (for visuals and templates)  
- **Google Sheets / Excel** (tracking and reporting)  
- **Notion or Google Docs** (for training material & reporting)

---

## 📊 Simulated Results & Impact  

- 📉 Reduced click-through rates from **35% to 10%** after training  
- 📈 Identified departments most vulnerable to social engineering  
- 🧠 Increased **security awareness** across the organization  

---

## 💡 What I Learned  

- How to think like both a **threat actor** and a **cyber defender**  
- Skills in **GRC**, user behavior analysis, and communicating cyber risks to executives  
- How to build awareness and strengthen organizational security from the ground up  

---

## 🌍 Opportunities  

I'm currently open to:
- 🌐 **Remote or hybrid roles** in cybersecurity and GRC  
- 🧪 **Internships / externships** (especially security awareness, SOC, or risk)  
- ✍🏽 Freelance or consulting opportunities globally
